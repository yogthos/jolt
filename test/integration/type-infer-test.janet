# Static collection-type inference, Phase 0 (jolt-6sr): intra-procedural.
# The pass infers an expression's collection type from literals/arithmetic and
# flows it through let bindings and if-joins. Where a keyword-lookup subject is
# PROVEN to be a plain struct map it auto-drops the :jolt/type guard (the
# inference output is the same ^:struct channel as a manual hint); where the
# type is unknown it stays :any and keeps the dynamic guard (sound fallback).
#
# Note: Route 1 scalar-replacement already eliminates NON-escaping let-bound
# maps outright, so these cases force the map to ESCAPE (pass it to `sink`) to
# isolate what inference adds — typing a map that survives and is then looked up.
