# Collection-element types + HOF awareness, Phase 3 (jolt-d6u). A vector carries
# its element type ({:vec ELEM}); a reduce/map/filter closure over it gets that
# element type on its element param. So a lookup inside a reduce closure over a
# vector-of-structs specializes — no hint — WHEN the element type is provable.
