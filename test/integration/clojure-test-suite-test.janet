# clojure-test-suite conformance: runs the external, cross-dialect
# clojure-test-suite (jank-lang fork) against Jolt and asserts the number of
# passing per-function test files stays at/above a baseline. The suite is a git
# submodule at vendor/clojure-test-suite (CI checks it out via submodules:
# recursive). The test SKIPS cleanly only if the submodule isn't initialized
# (run `git submodule update --init`).
#
# Each suite file is a `clojure.test` namespace (one per clojure.core/string
# function). A minimal clojure.test + portability shim (test/support/clojure_test.clj)
# lets Jolt load them; `when-var-exists` auto-skips fns Jolt doesn't implement.
#
# Files are run in a one-shot worker subprocess (test/integration/suite-worker.janet)
# under a wall-clock deadline. A few suite tests build infinite sequences that an
# uncompilable/eager path can't truncate and so HANG rather than fail; the
# deadline contains them — a timed-out file contributes nothing, no skip-list.

# Baseline: assertions Jolt currently passes across the suite. Raise as Jolt
# improves so a regression (previously-passing assertion breaking) is caught.
# Lowered 3915 -> 3913 when futures landed: `realized?`/realized_qmark.cljc has a
# `(when-var-exists future ...)` block that was skipped while `future` was
# unresolved. With futures implemented the block now runs, but it depends on JVM
# `Thread/sleep` (jolt has no JVM interop) and on `future-cancel` interrupting a
# running thread (Janet OS threads can't be interrupted), so `(deref (future
# (sleep 1)))` re-raises the unresolved-`Thread/sleep` error — a documented
# platform gap, not a regression in any previously-working behavior.
# Raised 3913 -> 3916 with the staged-bootstrap kernel tier (ns-restore-on-throw
# + faithful subvec coercion), then 3916 -> 3919 moving juxt/every-pred/some-fn to
# Clojure (the canonical defs are more correct than the prior Janet ones). Raised
# 3919 -> 3926 preserving nil map values (jolt-c7h): a nil value is a present key,
# which several suite tests assert. Runs read 3927 consistently, occasionally 3926
# when a timeout-prone test (of the 9 that can time out) doesn't finish; floor at
# the consistent-minus-one 3926.
# Raised 3971 -> 3981 with Option A full laziness (jolt-fng): transformers return
# lazy seqs, lazy interleave stops timing out, and the lazy-seq nil-element +
# non-seqable-input fixes (case/seq/reverse/empty? over nil-first lazy seqs;
# lazy-from throws on non-seqable like Clojure) recovered + extended the suite.
# clean files 45 -> 66 (Option A makes seq?/vector? results match Clojure across
# many cross-dialect files). Stable across runs.
