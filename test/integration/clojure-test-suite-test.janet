# clojure-test-suite conformance: runs the external, cross-dialect
# clojure-test-suite (https://github.com/lread/clojure-test-suite, EPL) against
# Jolt and asserts the number of passing per-function test files stays at/above
# a baseline. Like the jank battery, this does NOT vendor the suite — it
# references ~/src/clojure-test-suite if present and SKIPS cleanly when absent.
#
# Each suite file is a `clojure.test` namespace (one per clojure.core/string
# function). A minimal clojure.test + portability shim (test/support/clojure_test.clj)
# lets Jolt load them; `when-var-exists` auto-skips fns Jolt doesn't implement.
#
# Files are run in a one-shot worker subprocess (test/integration/suite-worker.janet)
# under a wall-clock deadline. Some suite tests build infinite sequences
# (cycle/range/transducers-over-infinite) that Jolt's eager evaluator can't
# truncate and so HANG rather than fail; the deadline contains them — a timed-out
# file is reported as :timeout and contributes nothing, no manual skip-list needed.
