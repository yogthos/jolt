# jank conformance: runs the Clojure-language pass-tests from a local jank
# checkout (https://github.com/jank-lang/jank, MPL-2.0) against Jolt and asserts
# the number that pass stays at/above a baseline. This does NOT vendor jank's
# sources (license differs) — it references ~/src/jank if present and SKIPS
# cleanly when absent, so it is a local/dev regression aid.
#
# Each jank pass-test is an assertion script ending in `:success`. We load it in
# a fresh context and count it as passing when it returns :success.
