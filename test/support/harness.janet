# Shared test harness for Jolt.
#
# Two complementary styles:
#
#   defspec — data-driven behavioral tables, for spec/ and integration batteries.
#     Each case is ["label" expected actual] where `expected` and `actual` are
#     Clojure source strings. Equality is checked with Jolt's own `=`, so it is
#     representation-agnostic (a vector result compares equal to a vector
#     literal regardless of the underlying Janet type). Use the :throws sentinel
#     in the `expected` position to assert that `actual` raises an error.
#
#       (defspec "clojure.core / seq"
#         ["first of vector" "1"       "(first [1 2 3])"]
#         ["rest is a seq"   "(2 3)"   "(rest [1 2 3])"]
#         ["nth out of range" :throws  "(nth [1] 5)"])
#
#   jeval / expect= / expect-throws — assertion helpers for white-box unit/ tests
#     that probe a single component and want Janet-level assertions.
#
# A failing suite prints every failing behavior, then raises — so `jpm test`
# reports a non-zero exit and the offending behaviors are visible.
