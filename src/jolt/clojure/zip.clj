;; Ported from clojure.zip (Rich Hickey). A loc is a vector [node path] carrying
;; the zipper fns (:zip/branch? :zip/children :zip/make-node) as metadata. The
;; reference indexes a loc with (loc 0)/(loc 1); Jolt uses (nth loc ...) because a
;; metadata-bearing vector is not currently invocable as a fn (see jolt-vh5).
