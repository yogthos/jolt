(ns jolt.passes
  "IR optimization passes (nanopass-lite, jolt-2om). Each pass is a pure
  IR -> IR rewrite, total over node :ops (unknown ops pass through with
  folded children, so adding a node kind can't silently break a pass), run
  in a fixed order by run-passes between the analyzer and the back end.
  Portable Clojure: same constraint as jolt.analyzer — kernel-tier fns +
  seed primitives only (it loads with the compiler namespaces).")

;; Folding computes with THE ACTUAL jolt fns, so a folded result matches what
;; the unfolded code would produce at runtime by construction. Conservative:
;; numbers only, the op table only names pure numeric fns, and any throw
;; during folding (e.g. (mod x 0)) leaves the node alone for runtime.
