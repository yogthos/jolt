(ns jolt.analyzer
  "Portable Clojure analyzer: reader form -> host-neutral IR (see jolt.ir).

  Pure jolt-core — depends only on the host contract (jolt.host) and IR
  constructors (jolt.ir), never on Janet. The contract fns are referred unqualified
  (host form predicates are `form-*` to avoid colliding with clojure.core), so the
  bootstrap can compile this namespace via its plain :var path. ctx is an opaque
  host handle threaded to the contract fns; the analyzer never inspects it.

  Coverage grows toward compiler.janet; unsupported forms throw :jolt/uncompilable
  so the caller falls back to the interpreter (the hybrid contract).

  `env` carries lexical state: {:locals #{names} :recur recur-target-name|nil}.
  Definitions are ordered so only `analyze` (mutually recursive) is forward
  declared — the bootstrap compiles forward refs through var cells, but keeping
  them to one keeps the compiled namespace simple."
