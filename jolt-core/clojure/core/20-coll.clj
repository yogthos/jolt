;; clojure.core — collection tier. Pure, eager fns expressed as compositions of
;; already-frozen core primitives (reduce/assoc/get/conj/filter/vec/count/>=).
;; No host internals, no laziness, no macros — so they compile cleanly and stay
;; redefinable. Loaded after the seq tier; self-hosted in compile mode.
;;
;; Same migration rule as the seq tier (see 10-seq.clj): not in core-renames, no
;; internal Janet callers, not used by the self-hosted compiler.

;; Base is (hash-map), not the {} literal: a literal map is a struct that doesn't
;; canonicalize collection keys across representations (a {:a 1} literal vs
;; (hash-map :a 1) key), whereas a PHM does — so counting/grouping by collection
;; value needs the PHM base (the prior Janet impl used make-phm for this reason).
