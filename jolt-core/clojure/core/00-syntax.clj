;; clojure.core — syntax tier. The control macros the compiler and every later
;; tier depend on (when/cond/and/or/...), expressed as defmacro. Loaded FIRST

;; them is compiled — including the kernel tier, the self-hosted analyzer, and the
;; seq/coll tiers.
;;
;; CONSTRAINT: code here may use ONLY special forms (if/do/let*/fn*/not) and
;; SEED primitives (first/next/rest/nth/count/seq/...), plus earlier defs in
;; THIS file. It must NOT use kernel-tier fns (second/peek/subvec/...) or
;; anything defined later — those don't exist yet when this tier loads. Raw
;; fn*/let* (no destructuring) and no when/cond/and/or above their defmacros.
;;

;; (backend/recompile-defns!) once the analyzer is alive — same lifecycle as
;; the defmacro expanders.

;; zero?/pos?/every? live HERE (not 20-coll): empty? below calls zero?, and
